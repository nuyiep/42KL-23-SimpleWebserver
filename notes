OSI
- 4th layer: transport layer 
	- makes sure that data are sent and received in the correct sequence
	- provides flow control and error handling
	- e.g. transport layer protocols: transmission control protocol (TCP),
			User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Sequence Packet Exchange (SPX)
	- mainly use TCP to implement HTTP server
- HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections
- Default port is TCP80, but other ports can be used
- HTTP only presumes a reliable transport

Steps involved in using sockets
1. Create the socket 
2. Identify the socket 
3. On the server, wait for an incoming connection
4. Send and receive messages
5. Close the socket

1. Create the socket
	- A socket, server_fd, is created with the socket system call:
		int server_fd = socket(domain, type, protocol);
	- All the parameters as well as the return value are integers
2. Name a socket
	- Assign a transport address to the socket (a port number in IP networking)
	- 

HTTP Methods
	- POST - create
	- GET - read
	- PUT - update/edit
	- DELETE - delete

select and poll
	- use for monitoring multiple file descriptiors (such as sockets)
	  in Unix-like operating systems to determine if data is available 
	  for reading or writing without blocking the program

select
	- E.g. we have a single thread that is avoiding dead waiting by using 
	  select
	- select tells us when connections have stuff for us to read
	- can monitor multiple FD simultaneously and notify when any of them
	  are ready for reading, writing

poll

 I/O multiplexing
	- Can be just one thread - one thread can handle multiple I/O operation
	  E.g. of multiplexing- In a school, there are 1024 students, one teacher can answer 
	  1024 student's questions. Each students take turns and raise their hands to ask questions 
	- Different from multithreading - multithreading- one thread handles only one I/O operation
	- E.g. of multithreading- In a school, there are 1024 students, each student is allocated 
	  with one teacher, where the teacher will only answer that particular student's questions
	  The teacher will wait while the student has no questions to answer.
